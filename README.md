## ⚙️ Tech Stack & APIs Used

- **Python 3.10+**
- **APIs:**
  - [Kiwi Tequila API](https://tequila.kiwi.com/portal/login) — for flight search.
    - ⚠️ Requires an API key and location codes.
    - Note: Limited daily searches depending on the plan.
  - [Sheety API](https://sheety.co/) — to interact with Google Sheets.
  - [Twilio API](https://www.twilio.com/) — for sending SMS.
    - ⚠️ Requires a verified phone number on free accounts.
- **Google Forms + Sheets** — for collecting user data and storing destinations.

---

## 📋 How It Works

1. **User signs up via Google Form** — their data is stored in a Google Sheet.
2. The app reads destination data from a separate tab in the same Sheet.
3. It fetches flight data using the Tequila API.
4. If a cheaper flight is found:
   - The app updates the Sheet.
   - Sends SMS and/or email alerts to all subscribed users.
